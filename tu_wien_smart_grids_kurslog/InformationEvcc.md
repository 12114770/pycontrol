
## 1. Overview of the Evcc Framework

Disclaimer: Due to problems with setting Up the Keba WallBox I did not use the Framework, still I will complete this form to my best knowledge

### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives  
Describe the primary purpose of the framework. What problems is it intended to solve or what functionality does it aim to provide?

Evcc is a framework that is able to connect to all the Smart-Home-Devices, that are 
related to Energy Managment.
It then is able to provide a frontend to read and interact with these devices.

### 1.2 Functional Scope  
Summarize the key features and functionalities offered by the framework. Highlight its core components, APIs, or tools.

It basically is everything you would need. You just configure the devices in a .yaml
(sadly I deleted mine by accident) and then by starting the app they connect.
You then have a frontend to interact with these devices. I could not test,
if there was a way for the devices to interact by themselves, as I am not using the framwork.

### 1.3 Addressed Limitations in the Field  
Explain which specific challenges or gaps in existing solutions the framework is attempting to address.

The big thing for me was the reliance on Modbus TCP. For some reason the KEBA KC P30
did not let me conncet via Modbus TCP and also did not respond to any TCP connection.



### 1.4 Maintenance and Community Support  
Is the framework actively maintained? Include information on the frequency of updates, responsiveness of maintainers, and size/activity of the community.

I think there is a company behind Evcc.(You need a premium subscription to be able to setup the WallBox via GUI). So it should be maintained, yet not open source.

### 1.5 State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Context  
Provide context on how the framework aligns with or deviates from current state-of-the-art approaches in the relevant field.

Well it aligns in that way, that all of these Framworks work with Modbus TCP, which rendered all of them useless for me. Sadly for that reason I cannot give a good Comparison.

#### 1.5.1 Related Tools and Alternatives  
List and briefly describe similar tools or frameworks that address the same or similar problems.

Looking at my project: github.com/12114770/pycontrol it does basically the same.
But of course my project is much more limited in scope as it only integrates one Wallbox and One Inverter. Allthough these two seem to be pretty widely adopted.


#### 1.5.2 Relevant Research Literature  
Reference any scientific publications or research projects that support the goals or methodologies of the framework or used this framework for their study.

Sadly I didn't dig deep enough to do this.

#### 1.5.3 Existing Implementations or Applications  
Note where the framework has been adopted or integrated in real-world or academic projects.

A collegue of my father uses this with her own Wallbox and if everything connects, it seems to be pretty smooth and potent.


### 1.6 Architectural and Structural Visualization

Provide a high-level visual representation of the framework's architecture or internal structure. This may include sequence diagrams, component diagrams, data flow diagrams, or any other visualization that illustrates the system's core processes and interactions.

- **Sequence Diagrams:** Show interactions between components or services over time (e.g., how data flows through the system).
- **Component Diagrams:** Depict the modular structure, key building blocks, and their relationships.
- **Data Flow or Pipeline Diagrams:** Visualize how data moves through the framework from input to output.

If no diagram is available, describe how one could be constructed based on the framework's architecture and provide the rationale for the chosen visualization approach.

> You may embed an image (e.g., from draw.io, PlantUML, or Mermaid), provide a link to the diagram, or describe the structure in detailed textual form.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Documentation Quality  
Evaluate the clarity, completeness, and usability of the official documentation. Are tutorials, code examples, and API references available?

I only read the official guide, but it was really intuitive and more than sufficient.

### 2.2 Setup Requirements  
Detail what is needed to install and run the framework successfully.

You just need a general purpose computer, any OS even Mac is supported. But I think the binaries are only available for Linux Systems.

#### 2.2.1 Hardware Constraints  
Specify any special hardware requirements such as GPU support, memory limits, or processing power.

Ethernet or WLAN.

#### 2.2.2 Software Dependencies  
List necessary libraries, language versions, operating system compatibility, and other software dependencies.

Go must be installed.

### 2.3 Data Requirements  
Explain what types of data are needed for using the framework effectively.

It is mostly using Modbus TCP, with the sunspec sublanguage.

#### 2.3.1 Availability of Open Datasets  
Are there any recommended or supported public datasets? Provide links or references.

No

#### 2.3.2 Data Pre-processing Needs  
Describe the steps or tools required to prepare data for use with the framework.

You just need to setup the .yaml and then start evcc using this yaml.

### 2.4 Installation and Configuration Issues  
Report any problems encountered during setup, including bugs, version conflicts, or missing components.

Well for Keba only Modbus TCP was available.

## 3. Evaluation and Benchmarking

### 3.1 Performance and Efficiency  
Assess the framework's computational performance (e.g., runtime speed, scalability, memory usage) based on test cases or benchmarks.

Sadly not tested, because not in use. 

### 3.2 Effectiveness in Achieving Stated Goals  
Evaluate how well the framework delivers on its promises. Are the expected results achievable? Are metrics or validation methods available?

Sadly not tested, because not in use. 

### 3.3 Usability and Developer Experience  
Share personal experience with using the framework. Was it intuitive, flexible, and developer-friendly? Highlight strengths and pain points.

It was very intuitve, but the .yaml is not really flexible. If something is not supported, you will have a hard time implementing the support yourself.

### 3.4 Reproducibility and Portability  
Can results be reproduced easily across different systems? How portable is the codebase across environments?

As it is written in Go, with support for multiple platforms, that should be the case.

### 3.5 Community Feedback and Adoption  
Include insights from forums, GitHub issues, or other users. How widely adopted is the framework in practice?

Sadly I don't know.

## 4. Summary and Recommendations

### 4.1 Strengths and Weaknesses  
Summarize the main advantages and disadvantages of the framework based on your findings.

+fast and easy setup
+supposedly performant and efficent
-rigid system, no easy option to include not supported devices.

### 4.2 Ideal Use Cases  
Describe scenarios or types of projects where this framework would be particularly well-suited.

Basic homeautomation projects for people savy enough to read Documentations and write configuration files accordingly. But it is not suited for more custom home projects.

### 4.3 Comparison with Alternatives  
If possible, provide a side-by-side comparison with similar tools based on your evaluation.

I think, from what I have heard, home automation could have solved a lot of the problems I had. Yet it takes a lot more effort to set this up. Home Automation would therefore be more comparable to the program I built.

### 4.4 Evaluation Scorecard

Use the following table to provide a quantitative assessment of the framework. Please rate each criterion on a scale from 1 (not very) to 5 (very). This helps standardize comparisons across multiple evaluations.
